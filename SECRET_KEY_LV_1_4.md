couldn't identify anything about it. I told him it 
Was dug outta some ruin I'd been scaving in for the
Past month or so. Said it might have go back as far
As pre-augmentation. Then the old burn head told me
People find these kind of things from time to time.
Told me to forget about it, he'd take it off my hands 
For 100 bits. I said no thanks and pocketed it.
Now the funny thing is that I could swear I'm being 
Tracked. No clue what I found but it's important
To someone. My net feeds are buzzing, seems like
Whoever he put on me isn't afraid to let me know.
Now ..the really wierd part of this is I went back
And found another one. It fits. Maybe just me but 
I need an ice bath and haven't even jacked in lately,
I don't like this*@#$##$#@error
